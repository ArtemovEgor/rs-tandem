# Team Meeting #2 — Sprint 1 Planning

**Date:** 23.02.2026  
**Attendees:** Egor, Sasha, Katya  
**Duration:** ~45–60 min

---

## Agenda

### 1. Week 1 Progress Recap (5 min)

**What's already done:**

- [x] Repository created, CI/CD configured
- [x] Vite project initialized, folder structure set up
- [x] SCSS config, path aliases (`@/`) configured
- [x] Design tokens PR (`_variables.scss`, `_mixins.scss`, `_reset.scss`)
- [x] Developer briefing & Git cheatsheet
- [x] Team meeting #1 (kickoff)

### 2. Development Approach Decision (10 min)

**Two approaches discussed:**

#### ✅ Option A: Foundation First (recommended)

Build the app skeleton first, then everyone implements features on top.

- Everyone can start coding features in Week 2 without blockers
- Routing, layout, and types are shared dependencies — can't be parallelized later
- Mock Mode lets frontend work without waiting for backend
- Aligns with original Week 1 plan

#### ❌ Option B: Vertical Slices (rejected)

Build one feature end-to-end immediately per person.

- Without router → no navigation
- Without types → merge conflicts
- Without API Layer → inconsistent fetch calls
- Without layout → disconnected pages
- High rework cost when integrating later

**Decision:** `Option A`

### 3. Sprint 1 Task Assignments (20 min)

### 4. Dependencies & Key Sync Points (10 min)

```
Dependency graph:

Egor: Design tokens merge ──→ Router ──→ Layout shell
                                 ↓
                             Types (shared)
                                 ↓
Sasha: Express init ──→ DB schema ──→ Auth API ──→ Seed data
                                        ↓
Katya: Landing page (independent) ──→ Header (needs router links)
                                         ↓
                            Quiz prototype (needs types)
```

**Key sync point:** `types.ts` must be agreed upon before Sasha builds API responses and Katya builds widget prototypes.
